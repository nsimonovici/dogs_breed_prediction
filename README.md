# dogs_breed_prediction
OC Data Scientist path project

- exploring.ipynb : First approach notebook, testing data and image processing
- breed_prediction.ipynb : Apply pre-processing, extract SIFT features, cluster features as visual words then classify on test pictures
- transfer_learning.ipynb : Partial fine-tuning of VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network for our classification problem

Both classification methods are too computational greedy to run on my laptop, the aim here is to implement those and to get familiar with pictures classification and pre-processing.
